# BRZ Boilerplate

HTML5 Twitter Bootstrap 3 Boilerplate with Gulp and ES2015 modules

### How to use

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to work or `npm run build` to build

### Installing frontend dependencies
Since we chose to use bower to manage our frontend dependencies, you can run bower through a npm script called `bower`. For example, if you wanna install jQuery, you can run `npm run bower -- install jquery --save`. DO NOT forget the `--` after the `npm run bower`, otherwise it'll just run `bower` without any parameters.
